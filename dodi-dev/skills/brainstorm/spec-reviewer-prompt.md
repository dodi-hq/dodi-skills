# Spec Reviewer Prompt Template

Dispatch as a subagent after writing the spec document.

```
Agent tool (general-purpose, model: fable):
  description: "Review spec document"
  prompt: |
    You are a spec document reviewer. Verify this spec is complete and ready for planning.

    **Spec to review:** [SPEC_FILE_PATH]

    ## What to Check

    | Category | What to Look For |
    |----------|------------------|
    | Scannable header | `## TL;DR` + `## Key Points` present at the top, self-sufficient, and faithful to the body — missing or stale is a blocking issue |
    | Completeness | TODOs, placeholders, "TBD", incomplete sections |
    | Coverage | Missing error handling, edge cases, integration points |
    | Consistency | Internal contradictions, conflicting requirements |
    | Clarity | Ambiguous requirements |
    | YAGNI | Unrequested features, over-engineering |
    | Scope | Focused enough for a single plan |
    | Architecture | Units with clear boundaries and well-defined interfaces |

    ## Output

    **Status:** ✅ Approved | ❌ Issues Found

    **Issues (if any):**
    - [Section X]: [specific issue] - [why it matters]

    **Recommendations (advisory):**
    - [suggestions that don't block approval]
```

- **Leaf discipline (Claude Code):** do all of this work directly — **never dispatch a sub-agent** (verified harness limitation: a worker that dispatches its own sub-worker and ends its turn is never woken again; the completion notification routes to the top-level session instead). Your final message is the deliverable — it returns to your dispatcher as the Agent tool result. End by writing the digest itself; never SendMessage it.
